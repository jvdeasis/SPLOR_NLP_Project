       "\"\\n\\nStudy Abroad London Guide\\n\\n\\nSpring 2019\\n\\nJust in London for the Weekend:\\nDay One (Friday): Timmy Green for brunch, Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge/Big Ben, The Lawn (drinks if it’s nice out), Boxpark for an early dinner/late lunch and drinks, Reign or Camden Pub Crawl\\nDay Two (Saturday): Bea’s of Bloomsbury for tea, Notting Hill/Portobello Market, London Eye (don’t get tickets online, just buy them there), Camden Market for early lunch/late dinner (closes at 6pm), Platform 9 ¾, O’Neill’s at night for drinks\\nDay Three (Sunday): Breakfast at By Chloe., Covent Garden\\n\\nAreas of London:\\nCamden → easy to get to by tube, Camden Market, Some cool bars, sketchy at night\\nBrick Lane → good shopping and food, easier to get to by Bus\\nShoreditch → Fun to go out at night, Boxpark, Vintage Market, some of the best shopping in London, take the bus or uber\\nCity of London → business district\\nWestminster → touristy area, where Big Ben/Parliament is, easy to get to by tube\\nCovent Garden → take the tube, one of my favorite places in london, vibrant, good shopping and food\\nSoHo → Chinatown area, where you’ll be going out most of the time, can tube or uber\\n\\n\\nPubs/Clubs: There are SO many places to go out to in London.  You could go to a different place every single night you’re abroad and not repeat a place.  With that being said, the Pubs are VERY different from the Clubs.  Pubs usually close early and are VERY casual, most pubs don’t even have a cover charge.  Completely opposite from that is the London Club Scene.  London Clubs are very exclusive and you must use a promoter if you want to get in without having to pay for drinks, cover, etc.  Pregame a lot because drinks become expensive and ALWAYS bring ID out, especially to clubs because they will check!\\n\\nPromoters to Use For Clubs: Danny Diaz* (_danny_d on instagram), Kevin for Opium (404.kkevz), and Tiago for Scandal/Charlie (tgggdc)\\nIt’s easiest to reach out to promoters via instagram dm and then get their contact info to communicate through WhatsApp.  Literally the second you post an instagram story at a club you’ll have a million promoters flooding your DMs, but not all promoters are good promoters!! Maintain a good relationship with your promoter because then they’ll become more lenient with letting boys tag along, bringing you to more exclusive events/pregrames, etc.  We used Danny for basically the entire semester and he was our plug for EVERY single club in London.  There’s some promoters that only do certain clubs so make sure to check with them based on where you want to go!!!\\n\\nO’Neill’s → Chinatown\\nVery good abroad scene, lots of Americans, free cover before 12, good location, live music\\nScandal\\nExclusive, should use a promoter, dress up, amazing music and drinks, drinks are expensive if you don’t have a table, lots of fun, open wednesdays, fridays & saturdays\\nZoobar → Chinatown\\nPretty grimy, lively for a Tuesday night, nice mix of music, cheap drinks, 5 pound cover charge\\nThe Queen’s Head → Kings Cross\\nSuch a local spot, cool to just grab a pint, no cover, ran into Nick Offerman (Ron Swanson, Parks & Rec) here with his wife who is apparently famous too lol\\nJoe’s → Camden\\nVery cool late night spot, a lot of locals go here, place is decorated really cool, 3 pound cover charge, hippy vibes\\nThe Blue’s Kitchen → Camden\\nSUCH a cool place, lots of locals, literally met people from ALL over the world here, they have live music every wednesday and the performances are amazing, get a paloma, 5 pound cocktails on wednesdays, amazing vibes & decorated really sick\\nMahiki → Mayfair\\nGO ON MONDAYS. This has become such an abroad spot, make sure you go in with a promoter that gets you a treasure chest so you won’t pay for cover/alcohol, good music, get there early so you won’t wait on line for an hour (not exaggerating)\\nThe Roxy \\nIn between a bar and a club, go on Wednesday’s and get a pitcher for 5 pounds, 5 pound cover charge, frat-like music & vibe but super fun if you go in a big group, has become an abroad spot on Wednesday’s\\nCirque le Soir → Soho\\nSuper exclusive, so fun for a Monday, even with a promoter it’s still a 20 pound cover, definitely need to go here once because it’s such an experience they have circus performers walking around and a ball pit and so many cool places to take pictures, music is iffy\\nMillers → Kings Cross\\nLocal spot, lowkey, have karaoke nights, very chill, make this place your second home, 3 pound tequila shots\\nReign → Piccadilly Circus\\nI LOVE THIS PLACE. You can literally go here on any night of the week and peak. Amazing music and atmosphere. Definitely need a promoter with a table. 10 pound cover charge. Definitely dress up, it’s a much more exclusive club but it’s such an experience. My favorite club in London\\nXOYO → Soho\\nGo here on Monday’s! Such a fun time, it’s just like a frat.  It’s in between a bar and a club. Pretty similar to Roxy and Zoobar.\\nThe Friendly Society → Carnaby\\nThe sickest vibes.  I’m pretty sure it’s a gay bar but the absolute best place to grab cocktails during the day.  They have these gigantic bed-type couches to lay on while you drink and the entire bar is decorated so cool. Definitely go to at least once!\\nCharlie’s → Mayfair\\nI’ve heard of people loving this place but I wasn’t that into it.  I’m not sure if it was the promoter we used or the actual place itself, but it wasn’t my favorite.  10 pound cover charge and very upscale and exclusive club.  Need to wear a dress/heels here.\\nBlame Gloria → Covent Garden\\nYou must come here.  The absolute cutest place.  Pretty casual, you can come here for happy hour from 4-7 and they have get 2 drinks for the price of 1, or you can make a reservation and sit down at a table.  Super girly vibes and amazing music.\\nPiccadilly Institute → Piccadilly Circus\\n7 pound cover charge.  Kind of iffy.  Some people have had fun here, but I’ve only been on Wednesdays, when it isn’t as lively.  Music is good and the atmosphere of the place itself is so cool.\\nMinistry of Sound → Elephant & Castle\\nOne of the most FAMOUS clubs in the WORLD. You absolutely must come here.  I’ve only ever gone on Saturday’s because they usually have DJs come preform and you just buy a ticket online that is usually 15-20 pounds.  A more casual club and you can pretty much wear whatever.  People come here to do drugs lol.  One of the most fun places\\nTonight Josephine → Shoreditch\\nSister places to Blame Gloria so very similar.  However, MUCH girlier environment to Blame Gloria...and smaller.  A cute place to grab cocktails for happy hour or for someone’s birthday.\\nBelushi’s → Camden\\nChill bar, drinks are pretty inexpensive.  Came here during the Camden Pub Crawl and was one of the better places.\\nSimmons → Camden\\nSO much fun.  Amazing music.  Definitely more chill, but come on a Friday when it’s super crowded.  No cover\\nMonarch → Camden\\nSuper fun and an in between of a bar and a club. Came here during the Camden Pub Crawl, but if you come without then you have to pay a cover charge.\\nTonteria → Kensington\\nAnother Monday Night Club.  Come here with a promoter and get the tapas and margaritas before.  We literally did not spend any money and got an entire dinner and drinks all night.  Turns into a club at night which is super fun and a good crowd of people come here.\\nJuju’s → Shoreditch\\nSuch a cute spot.  Come here for happy hour, especially when it’s nice out because they have lots of outdoor seating.  Drinks are also really good.\\nQueen of Hoxton → Shoreditch\\nCome here for karaoke or happy hour.  It gets super crowded on Thursday-Saturday night.  Such a fun place.\\nThe Lawn → Tower Bridge\\nOnly is open during the spring, but a cute outdoor bar RIGHT under Tower Bridge.  Come here during sunset and grab cocktails, especially towards the end of abroad when it’s nice out.\\nPunch & Judy → Covent Garden\\nRooftop bar in covent garden that overlooks all of covent garden.. Super cute!! Come during the springtime.  Drinks are kind of expensive but I’m pretty sure they have happy hour\\nTiger Tiger → Piccadilly Circus\\nClassified as a “club” but super trashy and don’t need a promoter, etc.  Not a bottle service type club but more of a frat. Can be fun with a big group but it’s SO big and crowded and the lines for coat check, drinks, even just to get in takes a while.\\n\\n\\nRestaurants:\\nThe Big Chill → Kings Cross \\nCozy spot for drinks, very intimate, moderately cheap, good location\\nPizza Union → Kings Cross \\nReally good pizza, cheap, very quick\\nCaffe Tropea → Russell Square\\nObsessed with this place, macchiatos are amazing, has such a large menu, good for breakfast, located right in the Square so there’s lots of good scenery\\nHot Pot → Chinatown\\nAmazing dumplings, decently priced, right near all the pubs/clubs so it’s a good place to go to before going out, staff is so friendly and welcoming\\nNando’s → any location\\nGood for fast food, cheap, not amazing but also not horrible, have to get at least once while you’re in London\\nCarluccio’s → Russell Square\\nAmazing italian food, a little bit pricey, good location, get dessert it’s unreal\\nMike’s Cafe (January 15) → Notting Hill\\nSuper cute, large selection of brunch/breakfast/etc, cheap\\nMildreds → Kings Cross\\nConvenient location if you live in Chapter, vegan menu, a bit pricey, cute vibes, not my favorite food\\nSargeant’s Mess → Tower Bridge\\nGood location, cute spot, PRICEY, food is good though \\nHonest Burger → Kings Cross\\nActually SO good, pretty good prices for the amount of food that you get\\nDishoom→ Kings Cross\\nThere’s a couple locations across the city, I don’t like Indian food but I LOVED it here, prices are great too, good atmosphere\\nFranco Manca → Russell Square\\nReally good pizza, cheap, and they make everything SO quick, can get it for take away too\\nGranger & Co → Kings Cross\\nMultiple locations, SO GOOD, you must come here once, drinks are pricey but food is amazing, definitely go here for breakfast/brunch, very cozy spot\\nCreme De La Crepe → Covent Garden\\nSuper cheap and cute/cozy location, different kinds of crepes, definitely a good spot to come to in Covent Garden\\nRoyal Dragon → Chinatown\\nThis place sucks. I’m only putting it on here as a warning to not come here. The worst service I’ve ever experienced and I’ll end it at that.\\nRiding House→ Piccadilly Circus\\nCome here for brunch. Food is amazing and decently priced!  Such a cute and cozy atmosphere and located right off of Oxford Street\\nMau Mau Bar → Notting Hill\\nWe came in the middle of the day so it was more of a restaurant than a bar at that time but such a cute place! They had a live band and the atmosphere is so amazing\\nDirty Bones → Soho\\nExpensive but worth it. We spent like 40 pounds each on drinks and food but everything we had was one of the best meals we’ve eaten in London. If you don’t want to eat still come here for the cocktails!\\nSketch→ Mayfair\\nObviously a must-see when in London.  I’m sure you’ve seen their bathrooms all over instagram.  We went here for drinks which were so expensive but the bar is in the bathroom which is cool.  Come here for tea, not dinner because it’s not worth it and make sure that you make reservations!\\nNAC→ Soho\\nThe absolute best food I’ve had in London, like I dream about it!  Kind of expensive but BEYOND worth it!! Everything on the menu is amazing from the starters, to drinks, to desserts!  It’s a popular place so make sure that you have reservations.\\nTimmy Green → Victoria\\nSimilar vibe to Granger & Co, but better!! Such a great brunch spot and very reasonable prices for what you get.  Definitely make a stop here at least once.  Menu is very healthy for both food and drinks\\n\\nSights:\\nImperial War Museum → Had to go for a class excursion, gave me D.C. museum vibes, not my favorite but could definitely be interesting if you’re into history, in a great area\\nWestminster Abbey→ So pretty, have to pay to get in, spend at least an hour inside and can take pictures outside\\nHarrods → Cool to walk around, they have a small art gallery inside that has some cool pieces, has some good food stops inside as well, go to the champagne terrace\\nThe British Library → Gigantic, so many exhibits to see, definitely have to go more than once, got tea here as well\\nTower of London → Actually really cool, definitely a must see when you’re in London, don’t necessarily need to stick to a tour but just walk around and make sure you see the crown jewels\\nThe Shard → SO SICK. You get the most amazing view.  Definitely plan on coming here multiple times because you can go to a bunch of different restaurants within the shard.  The first time I went I paid 40 pounds for the viewing deck, but it’s so worth it because you can see the entire city and I went at sunset so it was such a pretty sight!\\nCovent Garden → Not really a sight but definitely a must see place!! The best shopping and everything is decorated so cute\\nCamden Market → You will fall in love with Camden Market.  The vibes here during the day are electric.  There’s so many things to do and see you could come here every single day and still not see it all!\\nBoxPark Shoreditch → Literally my favorite place.  You must come here.  I brought all of my friends here when they visited and they said it was their favorite place in London.  Basically just a huge place with different food and drink vendors but such an amazing environment.  You could also just come here for drinks because there’s a bunch of mini bars scattered around.\\n\\n\\nWeekend Trips: Everyone will tell you to book your weekend trips FAR in advance, but since I’m a procrastinator, I planned a lot of flights within 2 weeks of leaving and never really had an issue.  With that being said, the earlier you book things, the cheaper they will be so try and do it as early as you can.  Also stay as organized as possible.  I kept a google spreadsheets of all the dates, times of flights, and addresses of hotels to make sure that I had all the information that I needed.  To be honest, I genuinely regret doing SO many weekend trips because by the middle of the semester I was so tired of traveling and felt like I was just doing stuff because everyone else was doing it and I was actually sad to leave London on weekends.  It’s such a great experience getting to see so many places in such a short amount of time, but I wish I valued my time on just a few amazing trips, rather than a bunch of okay trips.  I also hate planes so that added on to my stress.  I know you can easily feel pressured to do the big weekends that everyone else does (abroadfest, st. patty’s, etc). but remember that abroad is YOUR personal experience so spend time doing what you want. My friends studying in other cities left literally every single weekend of the semester and didn’t care because they didn’t like their cities as much but London is so amazing, I would genuinely be sad/have fomo leaving on weekends.  When it comes to traveling, try and utilize Heathrow, Gatwick for airports as much as possible because they’re easiest to get to.  Try and avoid Luton because it’s super annoying and out of the way.  Take Eurostar as much as possible!! I cannot emphasize this enough!  It’s so much more efficient time-wise.  I took Eurostar to Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam.  I never had one bad experience with airbnbs, but of course I’ve also heard of people having bad experiences.  I never stayed in hostels, but I know there are super nice ones so don’t immediately rule them out.  Make sure you have converters for both the UK and Europe and ALWAYS make sure you have your acceptance papers with you when traveling because you WILL  get asked to show them whenever you leave and enter London.  Make sure to check the baggage size of airlines before-hand.  I flew easyjet a-lot and never had a problem, but I know RyanAir is picky, however, I avoided RyanAir at all costs because I am so afraid of planes.  Be prepared for delays and cancellations, I had an issue with this almost every single weekend.  I know it’s frustrating but most of the time things don’t run smoothly.  Try and coordinate flights with friends as much as possible because navigating an airport on your own is no fun.  Always pack liquids in a plastic bag beforehand because you’ll have to take them out.  Overall, just prepare for weekends as much as advanced in possible, pack the day before, & make sure you have all your documents! \\n\\nBath (January 19 - 20) → WOW. I truly wasn’t expecting to like bath, but I was genuinely beyond blown away.  I came here on a program trip and literally peaked (not kidding), also take advantage of program excursions. YOU MUST TAKE A TRIP TO BATH. I really don’t want to hype it up but it’s so underrated, amazing food, shopping, nightlife, everything! Definitely go in the thermal bath spa, I wish I had time to do it, it costs about 40 pounds.  Go to the roman baths, fashion museum, etc.\\nPlaces to Go Out\\nZero/Zero → honestly filled with high schoolers but SO FUN if you go in a huge group. It’s 1 pound cover charge and 1 pound shots, so you really can’t go wrong.  Good music.  A club scene but not a club dress code.\\nSecond Bridge → this place was literally a frat but it was so much fun.  Cover charge was 8 pounds, which was kind of annoying.  Definitely more of a clubbier vibe/dress code.  I was wearing jeans but the locals all had on dresses and skirts so definitely dress to fit in\\nPlaces to Eat \\nThe Stable → amazing food, cheap drinks, cozy spot. Definitely a good place for dinner and centrally located\\nMission Burrito → Went here because we didn’t realize that you needed reservations for food places everywhere so we got something quick.  It’s chipotle style but cheap and easy.  Unsure if it’s a chain or not\\nSally Lunn → GO HERE! It’s the oldest place in Bath and such a cool experience.  We didn’t need reservations but had to wait on line for like 5 minutes.  They put all of your food on these amazing flavorful buns.\\n*DISCLAIMER: many places in Bath require reservations, so do your research beforehand!*\\n\\nStonehenge (January 20)→ If you’re studying abroad in London, you have to go here because it’s so close, however, don’t prepare to spend time here.  It’s pretty anti-climatic once you get there.  We literally stayed for probably 20 minutes and all we did was took pictures.\\n\\nBrussels (January 26-27) → Brussels is definitely a cool place to see but don’t plan on spending a full weekend here.  Either spend one night or a full day here because it’s a small city and you can get everything done in that amount of time.  It rained the entire time we were there and the weather was a lot colder than London.  I took Eurostar both ways there which was super simple and took about 2 hours each way.  The city itself is very European and SO quiet during the day. We stayed in an airbnb about a 20 minute walk away from the city center but the airbnb was super nice so it was worth it.\\nPlaces to Go Out\\nDelirium → if you go to Brussels, people will tell you that you HAVE to come here.  The beer is really strong and cheap.  Good music and vibes.  It’s a bunch of little places in one alley way so you can hop around which is fun.\\nRoosters → Between a club and a bar but SO MUCH FUN. Get a rooster sex drink while you’re here. Down the block from delirium.\\nPlaces to Eat\\nDrug Opera → right in the city center, pretty expensive, amazing waffles\\nAl Piccolo Mondo → super boujee but amazing italian food, great location\\nWaffle Factory → small but has a good amount of seating, cheaply priced waffles, go here for breakfast\\nCafe du Sablon → I am in love with this place.  We randomly stumbled upon it and went in for coffee and it was the best thing I’ve ever had in my life. GO HERE\\nFritland → famous place to get fries, we waited on line for about 20 minutes, fries are really good but not much different than American fries\\nThings to Do\\nThe Sablon Antique Market → went here Sunday morning and it was SO COOL. We obviously didn’t buy anything but it was really sick to walk around and see antiques.  Lots of little shops to hop around from.\\nChocolate Museum → honestly skip this.  It was only 5 pounds but the museum itself had nothing to do with chocolate and everything was in French so we couldn’t read it.  They give you free samples though which was good.\\nGrand Place → spend a good amount of time here walking around and taking pictures.  This is the central part of the city and the most touristy\\nMannequin Pis → I don’t know why this is such a big tourist attraction but it’s a statue of a boy peeing that’s famous in Brussels.  Definitely go to see it but it’s so anticlimactic\\n\\nPrague (February 1-4) → Such a big abroad spot, but people that go abroad here hype it up WAAAAY too much. Don’t get me wrong Prague is so pretty but the people are insanely rude and there’s not much to do during the day. The nightlife is pretty good and everything is decently cheap. They have uber which is also really convenient. I had really high expectations for Prague but honestly it was just okay. I stayed from Friday-Monday which was way too long, I wish I stayed in Prague for 2 days and went to Vienna or Budapest for the other 2 days. It was also freezing and there was a snow storm Sunday so all of our flights back got cancelled and the people in the airport (which is the only airport in Prague) were so unhelpful and only spoke to me in czech so be prepared! 9 of us stayed in a super nice Airbnb.\\nPlaces to Go Out\\nKarlovy Lazne → 5 story club, SO MUCH FUN, each floor has a different vibe so you can stay for so long, it was like a $13 cover charge which is really expensive for Prague, but you must come here, right on the water\\nLucerna → this is the big abroad spot in Prague but I hated it.  The music was SO awful and you literally run into everyone that you know, you have to buy tickets before and wait on line which is also super annoying, but I think it was like a $4 cover charge\\nPlaces to Eat:  The best part about Prague was the food. Every single place that I ate was one of the best meals I’ve had abroad and everything is so cheap.\\nLemon Leaf → Thai food, really good, cozy spot, nice location, not expensive\\nCaptain Candy → Chain candy store, fun to walk around, didn’t get anything though\\nAgave → Mexican food, UNREAL, you need to come here if you’re in Prague, make reservations beforehand\\nCacao → People that go abroad to Prague love this place but I don’t understand the hype, good smoothies but food wasn’t amazing\\nMarina Ristorante → THIS WAS THE BEST MEAL I HAD ABROAD, you should make reservations for here the minute you book Prague, it’s on the water and has such an amazing view, Italian food and cheap\\nBake Shop → Multiple locations, go here for brunch, good smoothies and breakfast food, great desserts\\nTrdelnik → you can stop at any street vendor for Trdelnik because they all taste the same, but you must get it if you come to Prague it’s amazing, it their main dessert \\nThings to Do\\nJohn Lennon Wall → this was the biggest disappointment, I thought the wall would be miles long but it's literally like 50 feet long, you just go there and take pictures and we stayed for probably 10 minutes, so overhyped for absolutely 0 reason\\nApple Museum → don’t waste your time here, $5 to get in, people who stayed abroad in Prague told us to come here and I really don’t know why, it’s literally just old iphones and computers on display\\nPrague Castle → so pretty, have to climb up a bunch of stairs to get there, amazing view at the top\\nSex Museum → $6 to get in with a student discount, this was my favorite place in Prague, it shows the history of sex toys which was so cool\\nIllusion Art Museum → Randomly stumbled upon this place but so happy we went, it was about $5 to get in and has amazing art, so many good photo opportunities inside\\nAstronomical Clock → Go on the hour because the saints pop out at the top, if you go to Prague you have to see it\\nRoyal Garden → really pretty, takes about an hour to walk around to each little spot, you have to pay like $3 to get in\\nOld Tower Bridge → walking across this is surreal, best picture spot, amazing view\\n\\nAmsterdam (February 8-10) → Amsterdam actually lives up to the hype.  It’s such an incredible and magical city.  I had so many moments where I was walking around and taking everything in because it simply feels fake.  The city itself is actually pretty big (we had to uber a lot, but I know you can take the train/bus we were just too lazy for that) and it’s SO safe, despite the drugs and sex-- safe enough that I was able to walk around by myself at night and not feel scared.  People definitely come here for all of the fun things to do but the city has so much culture and so many cool things to see and do so make sure you spend a longer weekend here.  The people are incredibly nice and everyone is so friendly and happy, which makes the experience 10x better.  I took the train there and flew into Luton back and honestly the train is the way to go because you end up spending more time in the airport going through security and everything.  We pulled this trip together last minute, like I literally booked my flight/hotel within a week of leaving and it was decently cheap.  We stayed at the West Side Inn, which was in an iffy location because it was far from a lot of things, but it was fine because we were never in the hotel and once we left for the morning we were gone all day.  Amsterdam is 100% a must do weekend trip abroad!!\\nPlaces to Go Out: we didn’t go to any pubs/clubs while in Amsterdam because it wasn’t really the vibe.  We went to a coffee shop to smoke both nights and just hung out around the Red Light District, which is the most lively place to be at night in Amsterdam.\\nBulldog Cafe → This is a coffee shop chain all over Amsterdam and definitely the most touristy spot but you HAVE to go here.  We went to like 4 different ones and the vibe in each of them were amazing.  We bought like 4 pre-rolled joints for 14 euros, which was a pretty good deal.  After you buy what you want you can sit down anywhere and just chill out and order food which is definitely convenient.\\nMoulin Rouge → This was the sex show that we went to in the Red Light District.  It was 40 euros, which I thought was reasonable because it was an hour long and you get 2 free cocktails.  Definitely an experience and I’ll leave it at that.\\nKokopelli → This is where most people get truffles from.  The vibes in here are really cool and it’s a good place to go if you’re tripping/rolling.  A good place to hangout\\nMagic Truffles → Another place to get truffles.  I think it was about 16 euros for a pack. \\nPlaces to Eat\\nThe Pancake Bakery → Everyone says you have to come here and it’s true… IT’S AMAZING. We only had 3 people so we got a table right away.  The service is very quick so it’s nice to grab in the morning.  The menu is pretty big and everything is fairly priced and the food is SO GOOD\\nCobra Cafe → This is right in Museumplein so we came here after MOCO. Food was pretty good. Bathroom was sick, you have to pay a euro but honestly worth it lol.  We probably could’ve found a better place but we were starving and it was right near all the Museums.\\nHappyhappyjoyjoy → Every single person I know that has come to Amsterdam has came to this place.  It’s really good and the atmosphere is amazing.  I got the dumplings and fried rice and a glass of rose and it was under 20 euros.  I’m pretty sure there’s multiple locations.  Definitely make reservations before\\nCoffees and Coconuts → This is my favorite place on the list.  The vibes in this place is unlike any other.  You NEED to come here if you’re in Amsterdam.  We didn’t make reservations and didn't have to wait for a table, but by the time we left the line was out the door. Everything on the menu is pretty healthy and we sat on bean bag chairs which was so fun.  The food is so good and unique.\\nDe Tulp → This place was SO GOOD.  The menu was very healthy and kind of all over the place but in a good way.  The place is also decorated really cute.  Get the mixed fries!\\nThings to Do\\nHeineken Experience: YOU MUST COME HERE! We got our tickets online beforehand and still had to wait outside for like 15 minutes but it wasn’t a big deal.  This place is legit amazing and plan on spending at least 2 hours here.  It’s so much more than a museum and the bar at the end is the best part!! Everyone here is so friendly \\nLovers Canal Cruise: It cost about 15 euros but honestly so worth it. It was an hour longboat road along all the canals in the city and we went on a perfectly clear day so it was amazing.  If you’re in Amsterdam while it’s good weather definitely do a boat tour because it’s the best way to see all of the city.  I know there’s other boat tours with booze which seemed fun but lovers is the most popular.\\nMOCO Museum: My favorite part of Amsterdam.  They had most of Banksy's art here so it was amazing.  Definitely smoke before coming here because it makes it so much cooler.  You can buy tickets online, we didn’t and had to wait like 10 minutes which wasn’t a big deal.  There’s so much good modern art here you definitely shouldn’t miss out on it!\\nMuseum of Prostitution: 14 euro entry which was annoying but it was sick.  They let you stand in the window and walked you through the day in a life of a prostitute.  It was actually interesting if you followed along with all of the reading.  It’s a very quick museum and took about 20 minutes.  Centrally located in the red light district.  Highly recommend\\nA’DAM Lookout: We were going to skip this but I’m SO glad we didn’t.  This is the famous place where people go on the swings over the city (which you pay extra for).  We really wanted to do the swings but of course we went on the windiest night so it was shut down.  I would recommend doing this during the day and museums at night, which is where we messed up.  Entry was a little expensive but once you’re at the top it’s breathtaking.  There’s also a rooftop bar here so you could even spend a going out night here.  You literally get to see the entire city and it really puts into perspective how big Amsterdam really is!\\nVan Gogh Museum: We did this on the last day early in the morning and I’m so happy we did.  We spent about an hour here but we kind of rushed through it.  It’s 3 floors of all of Van Gogh’s art and it’s actually so interesting.  Lots of cool stuff and located next to MOCO. 20 Euro entrance fee and you have to get tickets online\\nAnne Frank House:  My friends went here but I didn’t because I didn’t get tickets beforehand.  I really wish I got to see it so definitely book tickets as soon as you know what weekend you’re going to Amsterdam.  Definitely a must see! You can’t get tickets at the door so don’t even attempt.\\n\\nBarcelona (February 28-March 3) → Truly the best weekend of all of abroad.  I went into this weekend with zero expectations, being that I’ve heard mixed reviews about barce and knowing that I was only going for abroadfest.  Barcelona is actually STUNNNNING and there is SO much to do, I wish I stayed longer.  You MUST go abroadfest weekend, make sure you buy your tickets early! Abroadfest itself is so much fun and try and make it on thursday to be there all 3 days.  We kept saying the entire weekend how we felt like we were on a spring break trip.  The city itself is huge and has so much culture, everywhere we ate was amazing!  We stayed in Hotel SB Icaria which was the perfect location because it was near the beach and all the clubs, which made it easy to get to abroadfest.  We really pushed ourselves to get everything done so we did abroadfest during the day/at night and then would get 2 hours of sleep to wake up in the morning and do touristy things, which truly is the best way to do it.  I have never been so sad to leave a place before.\\nPlaces to Go Out:  Being that we went for abroadfest, they pre-picked the places that we would go out.  Abroadfest didn’t have any events Friday or Saturday night so we went to springfest at Opium which we had to buy separate tickets for but it’s so worth it!\\nThe Wolf → This is where the abroadfest pregame was Thursday night so EVERYONE was here!  It’s definitely more in between a bar and a club and was a good place to pregame.  Music was pretty good but the drinks were kind of expensive.\\nRazzMatazz → This is where abroadfest was Thursday night for Tiesto and this venue is HUGE. There’s a bunch of different rooms and the main room looks like a concert venue.  Not sure how it is on a usual night but it was insane.  There’s multiple bars and an outdoor area.\\nShoko → SPREAD MY ASHES HERE. This is where abroadfest was during the day and it was magical.  It’s right on the beach so there’s an outdoor patio area to drink and smoke which is basically the boardwalk.  Such a sick club music was amazing and pretty spacey so it wasn’t overly sweaty.  You must come here!!\\nOpium → Obviously must come to Opium in Barcelona, I feel like it’s genuinely become a tourist attraction lol.  We came here Friday night for Don Diablo and had to buy tickets for 30 euros which was kind of annoying but SO worth it! Club is huge and definitely a bit more dressy.  Since it wasn’t an abroadfest event there was a lot more locals.  If you come on a regular night make sure to get a promoter with bottle service!\\nPlaces to Eat:  I did not have one bad meal in Barcelona.  Everything tastes so fresh and is pretty cheap!\\nWok-Organic Market → came here as soon as I got to Barce and I LOVED my meal.  It’s pretty cheap and good location near all the shops.  Service is fast so it’s definitely a good place to grab!  They also have amazing sangria\\nBrunch and Cakes → Make reservations for this place asap.  We didn’t, but luckily were able to get a table.  Just stalk pictures of their food and you’ll know why it’s so popular.  It looks just as good as it tastes and everything is decently healthy and priced!\\nFaraggi → This lowkey became our favorite place.  It was right on the beach/in walking distance of our hotel so we would come here in the morning.  SUCH good breakfast and you can eat outside with a great view!  Everything is cheap the people that work here are the sweetest.  There probably are better/boujee places in Barce for breakfast but I loved this place and we were always too hungover to seek out other places.\\nCDLC → The most instagrammable place/coolest vibes.  We only got sangria here because the food is expensive but it’s literally on the beach and the servers offer massages while you drink. Make reservations for this asap and don’t miss out on coming here! Located on the same strip as Opium & Shoko.\\nLa Boqueria Mercat → Definitely come here, everything is so cheap! Literally has every food you could ever want.\\nThings to Do: Obviously if you’re coming for abroadfest that’s probably the main thing that you’ll do, but there’s so many cute/touristy places and things to see in Barcelona!  Literally don’t sleep all weekend so you can do everything\\nPlaca de Catalunya → Huge park with pigeons everywhere (kind of scary) BUT there’s such pretty fountains.  I honestly sat here for like 30 minutes by myself and had the time of my life.\\nArc De Triomf → Such a cute spot.  Come here for pictures.  Not sure about the history behind it or anything but a good touristy thing to see while you’re here!\\nCitadel Park → Literally my favorite spot in Barce.  It’s the most stunning park ever, you honestly could spend an entire day here.  There’s boat rides in a small lake, which I wish we had time to do\\nSagrada Familia → If you want to go inside, make sure you buy tickets well in advanced.  We just went outside because we didn’t have tickets but it’s so pretty!\\nHappy Pills → not sure why this place is on every single abroad guide but it is!  It’s honestly cheap and a cute souvenir to bring back home so if you have time it’s fun to stop.  It’s literally just a candy bar that you fill into aesthetically pleasing jars.\\nPark Guell → Get tickets in advance.  Of course we came here on the hottest day so we were dying but it’s such a beautiful place!  Go to the top near all the benches for pictures.  I think it’s about 10 euros per entry but it’s huge and there’s so many different parts to it.\\n\\nParis (March 7-10) → I fell in love with Paris.  Just walking through the streets feels like a fairytale!  People have talked about how the locals there are rude but I didn’t get that vibe at all.  I took the Eurostar there both ways which is probably the most efficient way to get to Paris from London.  I stayed in a friend’s apartment, so I don’t have any good hotel/airbnb recommendations.  Paris is huge and there’s SO much to see so definitely stay here for a longer weekend.  They have Uber which is good but don’t abuse it because it adds up.  Try and take the metro most places, you can get tickets at any station!  Paris was definitely more expensive than expected and I found most places to be similar to prices in London, if not, more expensive.\\nPlaces to Go Out:  I wasn’t expecting must of Paris nightlife and I guess it’s good that I had no expectations.  It’s not as big as a clubbing scene compared to London.  Definitely a place with more chill bars, but still a good time!\\nYellow Mad Monkey → A bar located in Bastille.  Honestly a fun time. Definitely more casual and chill vibes.  Drinks are cheap.\\nCafe Voulez-Vous → Came here for cocktails and I loved it.  Music was so good and drinks were decently priced!\\nPlaces to Eat: I was looking forward to the food in Paris SO much, but I genuinely wasn’t that impressed.  I didn’t have any amazing meals, but they weren’t horrible either.\\nMaison Sauvage → came here for dinner but got a 14 euro avocado toast.  This place is expensive but it was my favorite meal I had that weekend.  The atmosphere is super cute and we ate outside.\\nCorso → italian food, came here for lunch.  Food is average, pricing is average.\\nMerci Jerome → AMAZING bakery.  Seriously had like 5 different pastries from this place and they were all amazing.  Super cheap & i’m pretty sure that there’s multiple locations.\\nRefuge Des Fondue → I had such high expectations for this place because I’ve seen it on instagram so many times.  For 22 euros you get fondue with meat, cheese, etc.  I honestly was hungry for a real meal which is why I didn’t enjoy it as much but it was still good.  They serve you alcohol in baby bottles, which is what makes it such a hot spot.  It’s SUPER tiny inside, so you need reservations for this place.  It was definitely overhyped.\\nLe Baili De Suffren → The most overpriced place I’ve ever been.  It’s right near the Eiffel Tower so it’s just a tourist trap but we were starving.  Food is pretty good but not worth it.\\nAux Art Etc… → You MUST come here for breakfast.  Service is amazing, food is incredible and presentation of the food is unreal.  Price is reasonable for what they offer.  This was my favorite place for breakfast.  We didn’t make reservations and it was pretty empty when we went.\\nLaduree → Famous macaroon place in Paris.  They have them ALL over the city.  Pretty sure you can get tea and sit down but we just grabbed things to go.  Honestly worth the hype, they’re SO good.\\nThings to Do: There are so many things to do and touristy things to see in Paris.  Try and plan things out as much as possible so you can do all the attractions near each other at once, instead of going all around the city.\\nEiffel Tower → obviously the most touristy thing to see in Paris.  You can climb to the top for a certain amount of $$, which I didn’t do but I’ve only heard great things about it! \\nNotre Dame → free entry, came here for mass on sunday, which you don’t have to do but definitely a must see in Paris because it’s so beautiful/there’s so much history behind it\\nLouvre → Literally my favorite thing in Paris.  I wasn’t expecting much of it but there’s SO much inside besides the Mona Lisa.  We spent about an hour and a half inside and it’s about 10 euros for entry. Definitely come\\nVersailles → I don’t know why Versailles isn’t on every single abroad guide but it should be.  You definitely need a whole afternoon to do it, but if you have time YOU NEED to come here.  It was my favorite thing that I did all weekend.  The grounds are absolutely stunning and you will feel so boujee being there.  It’s 20 euros, which seems expensive but it’s beyond worth it because you spend so much time there.  You need to get a train ticket there & the train takes about 40 minutes.  There’s also places to eat and shop inside.\\nPantheon → If you’re into history then come here but I wish I skipped out.  It was 7 euro entry and it’s just a huge memorial for war heroes, etc.  It’s such a beautiful building and you can pay for admission to the top with an entire view of Paris, but we didn’t do that.\\nCatacombs → I have never been more terrified.  We got in for free as student admission.  It’s honestly SO cool to do because there’s nothing else like it in the world but it’s actually so eerie.  Definitely go with a group if you’re going to do it because you’re pretty much alone the entire time/ can’t see other groups of people when you’re walking through.  It’s a little claustrophobic inside, but overall it’s just 30 straight minutes of walking through caves of bones.\\nBoat Tour → I am SO happy we did this.  It was 12 euros and it takes you all over Paris.  We did it at night which was such a great way to see the city and it brings you to the Eiffel Tower on the hour when it sparkles.  You can bring your own food/drinks on it so we literally brought a wine and cheese spread which was the move.  It takes an hour and is such a good thing to do after dinner and before going out.  Highly recommend doing a boat tour.\\nSacré-Cœur → Definitely come here… it’s free!  It’s a church at the top of a hill but once you get to the top you get a view of the ENTIRE CITY. It’s honestly the coolest thing and I don’t know why it isn’t more of a tourist attraction.  It’s surrounded by the cutest town with bakeries and afterwards you can walk around.  Such a cool experience once you reach the top of the hill and the church itself is stunning.\\n\\nDublin (March 15-17) → People tell you that you have to go to Dublin for St. Patty’s weekend and I personally don’t agree 100%.  To be honest, it was fun but I wouldn’t have had fomo if I didn’t go...it’s also the most expensive weekend trip. Dublin itself isn’t that amazing of a city and if you were to go for a different weekend you could probably do it in 2 days.  We booked our hotel (Hidden Gem Apartments) back in October, which honestly was too late, but we still managed to get a good deal.  Our apartment overlooked the temple bar area and was 3 floors which was amazing.  I literally booked my flights the week of and still paid the same amount as everyone else who booked theirs months in advanced.  This was the first weekend that we did not do a single touristy thing, which was a nice break.  I genuinely did not see one thing in Dublin besides the bars, which I kind of regret because we spent so much money, but there’s not much to do in Dublin anyway.  Make sure you pack warm because the weather is cold and rainy at this time.  Overall, it’s still a fun weekend but don’t expect to do anything besides drink all day and all night...it’s very similar to a St. Patty’s weekend at school.\\nPlaces to Go Out:  there’s an entire strip of bars on Temple Bar, but all the abroad college kids will end up at the same two bars.  The drinks are kind of pricey at each place, so try and pregame hard or sneak alcohol in.  Also as the bars get more crowded, they will only start letting you in if you’re 21 so make sure you have a fake with you.  I was lucky that I randomly brought mine.\\nFitzsimmon’s → This bar has like two floors with an upstairs outdoor area which was super cool.  Very collegey and crowded.  Mostly live music.\\nBusker’s → Bury me here.  This was the main bar that we all went to all weekend.  There’s an upstairs and a huge downstairs.  The upstairs has live music and the basement is more current music, so most of the time we spent in the basement.  Definitely a college bar vibe.  When it gets crowded the cover charge is 10 euros, so make sure that you have cash and don’t wash off the stamp that they give you because you can use it to re-enter all weekend without paying.\\nTemple Bar → the most touristy and crowded bar.  You must come here just to scope it out but it’s definitely more of an older crowd and local spot.\\nPlaces to Eat:  I honestly didn’t find any good food places in Dublin because everyone is too drunk and ends up eating McDonald’s all weekend.  I’m sure there’s better places out there than the ones I have listed, but we just went to places in the nearby temple bar area.\\nPorterhouse Brewing Company → Came here for drinks and food in the morning.  Drinks were kind of expensive, but food was good and reasonably priced.  Very good service.\\nBrasserie Sixty6 → Definitely come here for brunch.  Huge menu and food is amazing.  Such quick service, literally the fastest I’ve ever experienced while being abroad.  Reasonably priced and can take large parties.\\nElephant & Castle → Came here for brunch on sunday before the parade.  Good mimosas, pretty good food.  A little bit expensive but food is worth it.  Located right across the street from temple bar.\\nThunder Road Cafe → Everyone ends up here because it’s right across the street from Buskers.  Literally the Ireland equivalent to Friendly’s or TGI Friday’s.  Food is ehh but such good drunk eats.  Drinks are not good so consume at your own risk.  Not the best place but so convenient when you’re drunk.\\nThings to Do:  I genuinely do not know what there is to do in Dublin because we only did one touristy thing.  Most people I know only did like one or two touristy things.  I’m sure if you come on a weekend not on St. Patty’s weekend you could find time to do so many things but we didn’t want to miss out on going out.\\nDublin Castle → we came here and walked around, but didn’t pay money for a tour.  It was right by our hotel, which is why we went, but it’s super pretty and historical.\\nCliffs of Moher → honestly wish that I did this.  You have to take a 4 hour bus ride each way there and back, which is why we didn’t want to do it because you literally miss the entire day.  People that went on Friday got the most amazing view because it was clear out, but people that went on Saturday didn’t get that great of a view.  It’s very risky going when it’s bad weather and it’s super windy.  I think if you get to Dublin super early friday you can do it that day, but definitely don’t do it on actual St. Patty’s Day.  Everyone uses the same bus company.\\nGuiness Tour → It’s 30 euros and we skipped out on it because we all did the Heineken Experience in Amsterdam.  I’ve heard mixed reviews about it and most people liked the Heineken Experience more.  People just did it because it gives you something to do and at the end you get a view of the entire city of Dublin.\\n\\n\""
